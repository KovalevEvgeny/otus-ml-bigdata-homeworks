# Homework 1

## Linear Regression in Scala

In this homework, I needed to analyze and process the data, fit linear regression and estimate quality of the model. I decided to use RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error) as a quality metric.

My solution is contained in the following files:

* `hw1.ipynb`: I used almond Scala 2.12 kernel, Apache Spark for data processing and Breeze for constructing linear regression.
* `plots.ipynb`: I didn't manage to create plots which I needed in Scala, so I used Python for them instead.
* `images`: folder with plots.
