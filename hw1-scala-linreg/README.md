# Homework 1

## Linear Regression in Scala

In this homework, I needed to analyze and process the data, fit linear regression and estimate quality of the model. I decided to use RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error) as a quality metric.

My solution is contained in the following files:

* [`hw1.ipynb`](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/KovalevEvgeny/otus-ml-bigdata-homeworks/blob/main/hw1-scala-linreg/hw1.ipynb): I used almond Scala 2.12 kernel, Apache Spark for data processing and Breeze for constructing linear regression.
* [`plots.ipynb`](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/KovalevEvgeny/otus-ml-bigdata-homeworks/blob/main/hw1-scala-linreg/plots.ipynb): I didn't manage to create plots which I needed in Scala, so I used Python for them instead.
* `images`: folder with plots.
